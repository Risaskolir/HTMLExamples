		<h3 id="text"> How to manipulate text </h3>
		
		<hr /> <!-- You can use the empty tag hr to create a line or some other denotation that separates two pieces of the web page -->
		
		<h1> The h1 tag makes the largest header you can have. </h1>
		
		<h6> The h6 tag makes the smallest header you can have. </h6>
		
		<p> This is a paragraph of text, created with the p tag.</p>
		
		<p> When two or more paragraphs are together, they have a space between them. </p>
		
		<p> Additionally, you can <b> bold </b> and <i> italicize </i> words by using the <i>b</i> and <i>i</i> tags respectively. 
			Line breaks are done using the <i>br</i> empty tag, and you can add <sup> supertext </sup> and <sub> subtext </sub> by using
			the <i>sup</i> and <i>sub</i> tags.
		</p>
			
		<p> You can also make things more organized and easier to use screenreaders with by using some of the following tags. <br />
			<br />
			You can use the <strong> <i>STRONG</i> TAG </strong> to denote importance to the words. By default this makes the words bold 
			but it can also make a screenreader say it louder or with more force. <br /> <br />
			You can use the <em> em tag </em> to denote emphasis on the words.  By default this italicizes the words. but it can also 
			make screenreaders add an inflection to the words as well. <br /> <br />
			There is also the <q><i>q</i> tag </q> which is supposed to add quotation marks around the word, but it does not on IE so people
			don't use it often.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p> Block quotes are done  using the <i>blockquote</i> tag, with a paragraph tag inside of it.  It usually indents text on the screen, 
				but if you just want to indent a piece of text, you should usually do this using CSS.  You can additionally add
				a source to a block quote by using the <i>cite</i> attribute, which is followed by a URL to tell the user where the info came from. 
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p> You can also show how changes have been made by using the <del><i>del</i></del> tag, which stands for deleted and strikes through
			the word, and the <ins><i>ins</i></ins> tag, which stands for inserted and underlines the word. You can strike through a <s>word</s>
			without denoting a deletion by using the <i>s</i> tag, and can you can underline a <u>word</u> using the <i>u</i> tag, though the latter is 
			being phased out. 
		</p>
