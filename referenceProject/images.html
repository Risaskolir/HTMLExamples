		<p> Images can be added by creating an images folder in the folder that you can path to using the directory navigations discussed above.
			To use an image from this folder on your web page, perform the following steps.
			<ol>
				<li> Use the <i>img</i> (image) empty tag to tell the page that you are loading an image. </li>
				<li> Add the attribute <i>src</i> (source) and add the location and name of the image. It should look like src="images/xyz" or similar. </li>
				<li> Add the attribute <i>alt</i> (alternate) for people that use screen readers or if someone wants a textual description of the image. 
					 If the image is a meaningless graphic and does not need description, just put empty quotes instead of text.</li>
				<li> (Optional) Add the attribute </i>title</i>, which usually creates a tooltip on the image when it is moused over. </li>
				<li> (Optional but recommended) Add the <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> attributes, which tells the web page how large to draw the image. </li>
			</ol>
			
			Images are placed in-line, which means that they will be placed in the spot where the code was entered. This means that if you place it 
			inside of a paragraph tag it will appear inside of the paragraph and may possibly disrupt the text.  You can fix this by placing them 
			outside of the more detailed bodies of code, or you can use CSS to align them to wherever you want. 
		</p>
			
		<p> jpg, png, and gif image formats are the most common and widely accepted to use in web design, each having advantages and disadvantages, 
			which I will not go into here.
