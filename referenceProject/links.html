		<h3 id="links"> How to use links and directory navigations</h3>
		<hr />
		
		
		<p> You can create links using the <i>"a"</i> tag.  Setting the link requires you to use the <i>href</i> attribute. 
			For example: href= "xyz.com".  By using an absolute URL, you can link to another site.  If you use relative URLs, 
			you just need to specify the file location of the link.  You can move around the file structure using: 
			<ul>
				<li> Use the exact filename if the file you are running is in the same folder as the one you are linking to. </li>
				<li> if you need to access a file in a child folder, put the name of the file followed by a forward slash and then the filename. </li>
				<li> To go up a file use ../ to before the filename to indicate moving up.  You can add more ../s to continue to climb up the file tree. </li>
				<li> The main file (or homepage) of each folder in a directory is called index.html. This is so if no name is specified in a link, it can us this instead.  </li>
				<li> You can have the link activate an email interface by using href="mailto:xyy@pnq.com" </li>
				<li> Open a link in a new window or tab by adding the attribute target to the link and using the variable "_blank".</li>
				<li> You can link to different parts of the same page by adding an <i>id</i> attribute to any element on the page. 
					 Then use #idName to link to it in the href attribute. </li>
			</ul>
